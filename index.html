            <h1>What is GameLink?</h1>
            <p>GameLink is an intuitive app designed for playing games and sharing your<br>creative works effortlessly with fellow users on Discord. Paired with our<br>dedicated bot, GameLink offers a seamless solution for aspiring creators<br>to showcase their talents, collaborate with others, and celebrate media in<br>all its forms, no matter the medium.<br><br>Born from years of research into various media production methods,<br>GameLink addresses a significant gap: the lack of platforms that allow<br>independent creators to showcase their work without facing gatekeeping.<br>We believe everyone should have the opportunity to explore their creativity<br>and share their passions without barriers.</p>
